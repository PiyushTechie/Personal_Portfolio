## Setup & Local Development

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 18+ (includes npm)
- **Git** for version control

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PiyushTechie/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Create environment variables file (`.env`):**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. **Configure environment variables:**
Edit `.env` and add your credentials (see Environment Variables section below):
```env
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id_here
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id_here
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
```

### Running Locally

**Development server with Hot Module Replacement:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. Changes to React components will refresh instantly.

**Production build:**
```bash
npm run build
```
Outputs optimized bundle to `dist/` directory for deployment.

**Preview production build locally:**
```bash
npm run preview
```
Serves the production build to verify optimization before deploying.

**Linting:**
```bash
npm run lint
```
Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues and style violations.

### Environment Variables

**Required for email functionality:**
- `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID` — EmailJS service identifier (obtained from [EmailJS dashboard](https://dashboard.emailjs.com))
- `VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID` — EmailJS template ID
- `VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY` — EmailJS public API key

Environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` are automatically exposed to the client. These credentials are safe because EmailJS uses server-side validation to prevent unauthorized requests.

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/component-name

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new component with description"

# Push to origin
git push origin feature/component-name

# Create pull request for code review
```

## Performance & Best Practices

### Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- **GitHub section** is lazy-loaded with React.Suspense to defer non-critical API calls
- **Vite's dynamic imports** automatically split code at component boundaries
- Only loaded resources are shipped on initial page load

### Bundle Optimization
- **Tree-shaking** removes unused code from dependencies (especially icon libraries)
- **CSS purging** via Tailwind ensures only used utility classes are included
- **Minification & compression** handled automatically by Vite build process

### Animation Performance
- **Hardware acceleration** via CSS transforms (`translate`, `scale`, `opacity`)
- **will-change property** hints browser to optimize rendering
- **Framer Motion's GPU acceleration** for smooth 60fps animations
- **requestAnimationFrame** for paint-efficient transitions

### SEO & Metadata
- **Semantic HTML** with proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>` for title, `<h2>` for sections)
- **Meta viewport** for mobile responsiveness
- **Title tag** for browser/search engine indexing
- **Social sharing** ready with proper Open Graph metadata (can be extended)

### Accessibility Checklist
- Text alternatives for icons via aria-labels
- Sufficient color contrast ratios (WCAG AA standard)
- Keyboard-navigable interactive elements
- Focus management in modals and dynamic content
- Semantic landmarks (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`)

### Security Hardening
- **Content Security Policy** restricts script execution and resource loading
- **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** prevents MIME sniffing attacks
- **X-Frame-Options: DENY** blocks clickjacking attempts
- **Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin** controls referrer information
- **HTTPS-only** enforced on production (Vercel default)
- **Input validation** via Yup schema before form submission
- **Bot detection** honeypot field silently discards spam submissions
